# ChattingApp
Real-time messenger using ASP.NET WebApi, Entity Framework, SignalR and AngularJS
Example of usage:
  1. Let's asume I want to create a user with username "PettyLover" and then login into application
  ![alt Sign Up](https://github.com/SergiyLichenko/ChattingApp/blob/master/Smart/Docs/SignUp.png)
  2. And then login into application
  ![alt Login Page](https://github.com/SergiyLichenko/ChattingApp/blob/master/Smart/Docs/Login.png)
  3. Now I'm in the messenger, but I don't have any chats, so let's create our first chat by clicking "Create Chat" in the left dropdown list
  As you can see, you have to type the name of the chat and give it the avatar

  4. You can also watch all available public chats in the application by clicking "Join Chat" in the left dropdown list
  Right now there are only 2 chats available on the server: first is created by me, and second - created by other user, and I can join the second one:

  ![alt Login Page](https://github.com/SergiyLichenko/ChattingApp/blob/master/Smart/Docs/2%20Chats.png)

  6. Let's create another user and login from another browser (pretend like this will be the second person with whom we what to have a conversation)
  
   ![alt Login Page](https://github.com/SergiyLichenko/ChattingApp/blob/master/Smart/Docs/2%20users.png)
  
  So right now, I have 2 users in on both chats, and it is time for first message!:
  
  7. Second user (the right one) is sending a message:
  
   ![alt Login Page](https://github.com/SergiyLichenko/ChattingApp/blob/master/Smart/Docs/FirstMessage.png)
   
  8. And it immediately appears on the screen of first user (the left one):
